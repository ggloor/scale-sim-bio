DESeq2 was used to conduct a differential abundance (DA) analysis on the yeast transcriptome dataset.

Each point represents the values for one transcript, with the color indicating if that transcript was significant in the ALDEx2 scaled analysis and the DESeq2 analysis (red) or in the DESeq2 unscaled analysis only (orange).

Panel A shows that the data are over-dispersed relative to a Poisson distribution which is represented by the dashed line when plotted on a log-log scale. Panel B shows that the relationship between the mean and the dispersion calculated in DESeq2, here the standard error (SE) of the mean, is very different when the data are log-transformed first. Panel C shows the equivalent values calculated by ALDEx2 in which the expected CLR value for each transcipt are plotted vs.~the expected dispersion. Panel D shows the output for ALDEx2 with \(\gamma =0.5\). The red line in each panel shows the LOESS line of fit to the mid-point of the distributions. In panels B and C the amount of dispersion reaches a minimum at moderate values. The dashed orange line in panel A is the line of equivalence, and in panel B and C is the minimum y value.

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {6}{\ignorespaces Shown here are the mean log2 fold change as a density plot, and a Volcano plot showing the location and adjusted p-value for each feature in the metatranscriptomic dataset. The DESeq2 approach does a good job of centring this data, while edgeR is less suitable. The volcano plots show dramatically different outcomes. The DESeq2 algorithm assigns very large fold changes to features that have only moderate change, and further identifies a very large proportion of features as significantly different. In contrast, edgeR exhibits a much smaller number of differentially abundant features. In both volcano plots, the housekeeping genes in the main Figure 3 are shown in orange. We can see that these are asymmetrically distributed in both plots. Additionally the location of the features that DESeq2 identified as having a very large difference are shown in the edgeR volcano plot as blue circles.}}{6}{figure.6}\protected@file@percent }
