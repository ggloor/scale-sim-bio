Panel A shows that the data are over-dispersed relative to a Poisson distribution which is represented by the dashed line when plotted on a log-log scale. Panel B shows that the relationship between the mean and the dispersion calculated in DESeq2, here the standard error (SE) of the mean, is very different when the data are log-transformed first. Panel C shows the equivalent values calculated by ALDEx2 in which the expected clr value for each transcipt are plotted vs.\nobreakspace  {}the expected dispersion. The red line in each panel shows the loess line of fit to the mid-point of the distributions. In panels B and C the amount of dispersion reaches a minimum at moderate values. The dashed orange line in panel A is the line of equivalence, and in panel B and C is the minimum y value. The values below the dashed grey line in panels B and C represent those below the first decile of dispersion.}}{4}{figure.1}}

Panels A,B,D,E are for the unscaled analysis, and Panels C,F are for the scaled analysis. Each point represents the values for one transcript, with the color indicating if that transcript was significant in the scaled analysis and unscaled analysis (red) or in the unscaled analysis only (orange). Points in grey are not statistically signficantly different with any analysis. The horizontal dashed lines represent a log2(difference) of 1.4, which is a commonly applied cutoff when the majority of features are statistically significant.}}{5}{figure.2}}

Panel A shows an effect plot for the default analysis where the functions that are elevated in the healthy individuals have positive values and functions that are elevated in BV have negative values. Highlighed in the box are highly abundant KOs that are almost exlusively housekeeping functions, with ribosomal KOs highlighted in blue, statistically significant (FDR \textless {} 0.01) functions in red, and non-significant functions in black or orange. These housekeeping functions should be located on the midline of no difference. Panel B shows the same data scaled with \texttt  {gamma\ =\ 1}, which increase the minimum dispersion approximatly by one unit. Here the housekeeping functions from Panel A are colored cyan or blue for reference. Panel C shows the same data scaled with \texttt  {gamma\ =\ 0.75} and a 0.15 fold difference in dispersion applied to the BV samples relative to the H samples. The orange functions are now statistically significant. Note that this shifts the midpoint of the housekeeping functions towards the midline.}}{7}{figure.3}}
